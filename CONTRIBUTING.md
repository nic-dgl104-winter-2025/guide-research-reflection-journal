# Community Code Part 1 - CONTRIBUTING.md Guide
_A guide to writing the CONTRIBUTING.md document_

## Introduction
The README.md document in this Research and Reflection Journal repository will contain the documentary record of most of the work that you will do for weekly  REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED activities, as well as documentation for your contributions for Part 2 of the Community Code project.

_This_ CONTRIBUTING.md document is a separate record intended to ensure that we have a clear and separable record of the work you do to support your _external_ open source community. While it would be better for this documentation to appear in the associated forked repository, it is best to keep that fork clean, so we'll store information here instead.

## Expectations
Please make sure to read the complete Community Code Project assignment description and rubric on Brightspace. To document your work with your chosen external open source community, you should include the following:
- Basic information about the open source project
- A link pointing to your fork of the project
- Summary of issues examined
- Detailed discussion of issues contributed to
- Detailed discussion of code review and outcomes
- Reflection on success (i.e. did you solve the issue? What roadblocks did you face, and how did you overcome them?)
- Discussion of next steps (i.e. what will you do with the issue as identified?).
