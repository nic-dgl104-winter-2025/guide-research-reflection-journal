# Research and Reflection Journal Guide
_A guide to writing an effective Research and Reflection Journal_

## Introduction
The Research and Reflection Journal (and repository) is a tool used throughout the remainder of the semester to document the work you do and the reflections you generate. For me, this document is the primary record that I will have of your process throughout the latter half of DGL 104; for you, it should be a record of all the efforts you've put into the course. Taken together, you should recognize that this is not a project to ignore!

You can use this guide as a model for how to complete weekly entries in your own Research and Reflection Journal. It is not intended to be prescriptive, however! Please take any approach you like to completing your own Journal, as long as it meets expectations! 

## Expectations
First, you should definitely read, in full, the assignment description and rubric posted on Brightspace. You will have work to complete in your journal every week (in particular, see the weekly REQUIRED activities). You are absolutely welcome (and encouraged!) to add _more_ than just the bare minimum (i.e., complete RECOMMENDED activities, and add other research and reflections as you see fit).

For the purposes of this guide, however, I will focus on the high-level expectations with an example of a single week's work. Your Research and Reflection Journal should be:
- Well-organized (so that I understand what day/week or assignment I am reading about)
- Informative (each entry should clearly indicate tasks and activities you've participated in)
- Reflective (each entry should demonstrate that you've reflected on the tasks and activities you've participated in)
- Complete (the journal should represent a complete accounting from week 8 through the end of the semester; it must also include a bibliography and in-text citations, where necessary).
- Well-formatted (I should be able to read the journal easily)

## How to use this repository
This repository contains:

1. This guide (README.md) demonstrating how to meet the criteria above via example.
2. A CONTRIBUTING.md document that also demonstrates the information that should be included there for the purposes of the Community Code Project - Part 1. 

I've included process notes in blockquotes below. These may help you interpret how best to write your own journal entries.

There is no need to clone this repository (unless you find any mistakes, and you'd like to generate a pull request to fix them! Bonus marks are available as bounty for fixes!)

## Week 8 - Research and Reflection activities 

> Make sure to use appropriate headings for each section!

### Research a new language

> The title "Research a new language" matches the [associated REQUIRED activity](https://ash-teach.github.io/dgl-104/#/dgl104-2024wi/week-08?id=required-research-a-new-language) from week 8.

I've chosen the language [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). According to the [Haskell Wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell), Haskell is primarily a research language that operates on the functional paradigm. Although it has historically been research-oriented, Haskell is used by many major organizations ([Introduction, Haskell Wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction#Does_anyone_use_functional_programming.3F) and [Haskell, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell#Industry)), and increasingly is used as an in-production language ([Haskell, GitHub](https://github.com/topics/haskell)) and one may even [build web apps using Haskell](https://haskell.dev/article/Building_web_applications_with_Haskell_A_beginners_guide.html)! 

There are many useful resources for learning and using Haskell. The [Haskell Wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell) includes links to most of them. A particularly much-loved text is ["Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!"](https://www.learnyouahaskell.com/), which is both practical and approachable in it's presentation of Haskell. This is particularly important, because programming in Haskell is programming in a pure functional language, which anyone coming from the OOP world will likely find challenging. 

### Write a user story

> Note that in this activity I choose to complete my work in bullet points, in contrast to the more narrative approach above. Either is fine (as long as bullet points are complete).


The app I have chosen is [Garmin Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.garmin.android.apps.connectmobile):
- As a user, I can view details of my most recent activity.
- As a user, I can see my average heart rate from my most recent activity.
- As a user, I can complete a self-evaluation of my performance during an activity.

Some acceptance criteria for the second user story:
- Heart rate data should be visible as a numeric value in beats per minute (bpm).
- Heart rate data should include a tag stating it is the average value, not the instantaneous value.
- Tapping on the heart rate value should open up a details window of heart rate throughout the activity.

### Choose a language for Community Code

> This activity is listed as REQUIRED in the week 8 content, but directions do not include completing a Research and Reflection Journal entry (instead, I ask you to complete a Slack post). However, it is valuable to include your thoughts in your Journal, then to copy-paste them into Slack, since Slack content will eventually disappear, but your repository will remain stable.

The programming language I choose to focus on for the rest of the semester is [Piet](https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html). I have no experience in this language, and I chose it purely because I wanted to pick something completely off-the-wall, which hopefully some readers will find amusing. Really though, I think it's a pretty novel idea and I would like to dig into how it operates. FYI, if you want to learn more about some very weird programming languages, check out the [Esolang Wiki](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page)! 

### Star GitHub topics and repositories of interest

> Similar to the previous activity, although this one is required there was no stated requirement to include a journal entry. However, in the case of this particular activity, it's pretty easy to record the actions you've taken.

I visited [GitHub Trending](https://github.com/trending) and starred the following repositories:
- [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
- [microsoft/AI-For-Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners)
- [microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners)
- [bigcode-project/starcoder2](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder2)

### Follow-up questions and reflections

> This is recommended work, but you should always consider completing it. Reflecting on what you've done (especially if you can do so immediately after completing a task) is a very effective way to improve learning. I won't provide any examples for reflection question answers (I don't want to imply a specific approach), but as a guideline you should aim for a paragraph answer for each question. More is totally ok if you have a lot to say about a specific subject!

### Bibliography

> You don't need to use standard a bibliographic format (i.e. APA, MLA, etc.)unless you want to. However, you _must_ be consistent in how you display reference content (include author and date when available) and you _must never_ include bare urls (i.e. the must always be [hyperlinked!]())

> The easiest way to manage your bibliography is just to add in a link here every time you find a new resource, then come back through later to do formatting.

> You don't need to include references for all sites you've visited - only those that you've take some information from.

> Notice that in the references below I have opted to include author where possible, and have listed the name of the article or page in quotations, followed by the name of the website. The link embedded in the name of the website points directly to the resource used, not to the main page of the site listed.

## Conclusion
The example above is a good approximation of what you should be doing on a weekly basis. Remember that the written work you do here is a record of the actual research work you've done, so feel free to use the document as a place to store notes and to commit changes with improvements and updates as you progress. In fact, check out the commit history for this README.md to see what I mean!

Hopefully this has been a helpful read for you! If you have questions, please get in touch!
